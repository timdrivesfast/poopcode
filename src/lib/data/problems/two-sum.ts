  description: `Given an array of integers \`nums\` and an integer \`target\`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to \`target\`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.`,

As we iterate through the array, for each number, we:
1. Calculate its complement (target - current number)
2. Check if the complement exists in our hash map
3. If it does, we've found our pair and return the indices
4. If not, we add the current number and its index to the hash map

This allows us to find pairs in a single pass through the array.`,
