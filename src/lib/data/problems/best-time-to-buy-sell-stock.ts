  description: `You are given an array \`prices\` where \`prices[i]\` is the price of a given stock on the \`ith\` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return \`0\`.`,

For each possible buy date, we look at all future days as potential sell dates and calculate the profit. If this profit is greater than our current maximum profit, we update our maximum profit.`,

As we iterate through the array:

2. We calculate the potential profit if we sell at the current price.
